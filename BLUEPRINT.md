# Blueprint for a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS)

This document outlines the blueprint for building a comprehensive Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS). The system is designed to manage laboratory workflows, samples, tests, and results, with a focus on integrating generative AI to enhance data analysis and reporting.

## 1. Core Modules and Features

A complete LIMS requires several interconnected modules. Here's a breakdown of the essential features for each module:

### 1.1. Sample Management

*   **Sample Login/Registration:**
    *   Register new samples with unique identifiers (barcodes).
    *   Capture metadata: sample type, source, collection date, etc.
*   **Sample Tracking:**
    *   Track the location and status of each sample throughout its lifecycle (e.g., received, in-process, stored, disposed).
*   **Chain of Custody:**
    *   Maintain a complete audit trail of sample handling.

### 1.2. Test Management

*   **Test Definition:**
    *   Define the tests that can be performed in the lab.
    *   Specify test parameters, methods, and required equipment.
*   **Test Assignment:**
    *   Assign tests to specific samples.
    *   Manage test queues and priorities.

### 1.3. Results and Reporting

*   **Result Entry:**
    *   Manual and automated entry of test results.
    *   Integration with laboratory instruments.
*   **Data Validation:**
    *   Automated checks for out-of-spec results.
*   **Reporting:**
    *   Generate customizable reports (e.g., Certificates of Analysis).
    *   Historical data analysis and trending.

### 1.4. User and Security Management

*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    *   Define user roles (e.g., lab technician, manager, admin).
    *   Restrict access to modules and features based on user roles.
*   **Audit Trails:**
    *   Log all user actions for traceability and compliance.

## 2. Architecture

The proposed architecture follows a multi-tier approach, similar to the existing project structure.

*   **`lims-core` (Core Logic):**
    *   **Entities:** Java classes representing the core data models (e.g., `Sample`, `Test`, `Result`).
    *   **Repositories:** Interfaces for data access (e.g., using Spring Data JPA).
    *   **Services:** Business logic for each module (e.g., `SampleService`, `TestService`).
    *   **GeminiService:** The existing service for AI integration, which can be expanded for more advanced features.

*   **`lims-web` (Web Interface):**
    *   **REST APIs:** A comprehensive set of RESTful endpoints for each module, built with Spring Boot.
    *   **Frontend:** A modern web-based UI (e.g., using React, Angular, or Vue.js) that communicates with the REST APIs.

*   **`lims-desktop` (Desktop Client):**
    *   A JavaFX-based desktop application for tasks that are better suited for a desktop environment, such as instrument integration or label printing.

## 3. Generative AI Integration (The "Smart" LIMS)

Leverage the existing `GeminiService` to build advanced AI-powered features:

*   **Automated Report Generation:**
    *   Use Gemini to generate narrative summaries for reports based on numerical results.
    *   **Prompt Idea:** `"Based on the following results for sample [Sample ID], write a brief summary of the findings: [Results Data]."`

*   **Anomaly Detection:**
    *   Train a model to identify unusual patterns or out-of-spec results.
    *   **Prompt Idea:** `"Does the following result for [Test Name] seem anomalous compared to the historical average of [Average Value]? Result: [Current Value]."`

*   **Conversational Data Analysis:**
    *   Extend the existing chat feature to allow users to ask questions about the data in natural language.
    *   **Example Chat:**
        *   User: `"Show me all samples from a specific source that failed the [Test Name] test in the last month."`
        *   The system would translate this into a database query and return the results, potentially with a summary from Gemini.

## 4. Development and Build Steps

Here's a high-level roadmap for building the LIMS:

1.  **Phase 1: Core Data Models and Services**
    *   Define the database schema.
    *   Create JPA entities in `lims-core`.
    *   Implement Spring Data JPA repositories.
    *   Develop the initial business services for each module.

2.  **Phase 2: Web API and UI**
    *   Build the REST controllers in `lims-web`.
    *   Develop the frontend application.

3.  **Phase 3: AI Integration**
    *   Expand `GeminiService` with the new AI features.
    *   Integrate these features into the web UI.

4.  **Phase 4: Desktop Client**
    *   Develop the JavaFX desktop application for specialized tasks.

### Build and Deployment

*   **Build:** Use Maven to build the project (`mvn clean install`).
*   **Database:** Use a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
*   **Deployment:** The `lims-web` application can be containerized using Docker and deployed to a cloud platform like Google Cloud Run (as suggested by the original `README.md`).
